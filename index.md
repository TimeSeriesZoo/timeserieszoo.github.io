# Overview

This website hosts a series of animated visualizers for exploring signal processing,
including demonstrating different kinds of time series and common processes in digital signal processing.

## Table of Contents

This site contains the following sections:

- [Time Domain Signals](/signals.html)
- [Fourier Transforms](/fourier.html)
- [Convolution](/convolution.html)
- [Filters](/filters.html)

## Usage

Animations are available for re-use under the
[CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license,
meaning they can be used with attribution.

Copies of the gifs are available on the
[Github Organization](https://github.com/TimeSeriesZoo/).

## Source Code

Animations are created with the use of the
[NeuroDSP](https://neurodsp-tools.github.io/) module,
an open-source Python module for digital signal processing for neural time series.

The code to make the animations, and copies of the visualizations are available on the
[Github Organization](https://github.com/TimeSeriesZoo/).
