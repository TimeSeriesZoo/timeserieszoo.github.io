# Time Domain Signals

The following plots show different kinds of simulated time series.

- the left plot shows the ongoing time series
- the right plot shows the corresponding power spectrum

## Oscillatory Signals

First, we have an oscillatory signal, showing rhythmic activity:

## Aperiodic Signals

Next, we will explore some aperiodic signals.

First, white noise, defined as having equal power across all frequencies (a flat power spectrum):

<br>

Next, we have pink noise, which has a pattern of decreasing power
across increasing frequencies:

<br>

Finally, we have brown noise, with has a steeper drop-off of power across increasing frequencies:

## Combined Signals

Next up, we have 'combined signals', which are a combination of periodic and aperiodic components:

Finally, we have a bursty signal:
